# STUS Orthogonal Projection Calculator

Graphic calculator that aproximates periodic functions by calculating it's orthogonal projection using Fourier Series.

## Features

- Continuous functions supported.
- Piecewise functions supported.
- Trigonometric polynomial orthogonal base supported.
- Settable subspace dimention.

### Under development

- Projections for R^n with generic inernal product.
- Settable orthogonal base input (for a given vector space).
- Settable inernal product input (for a given vector space).
