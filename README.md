# STUS Orthogonal Projection Calculator

&nbsp; [Stus Calculator](https://github.com/mrmalvicino/stus-calculator) is a graphic calculator that aproximates periodic functions by calculating it's orthogonal projection over a trigonometric polynomials vector space.

## Features

### Settable subspace dimension

&nbsp; The dimension of the vector space can be modified in order to determine the precision of the aproximation.

&nbsp; The following plot represents an aproximation over a 11th dimention vector space.
